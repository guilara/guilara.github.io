### About

I am a posdoc a the [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/) (Albert Einstein Institute). I did my PhD in Astroparticle Phyisics at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) as part of the [ERC group](https://grams-815673.wixsite.com/2019) of Prof. Enrico Barausse.

### Research

Currently I study compact objects in alternative theories of gravity with numerical relativity. In my previous research I also studied the phenomenology of these objects with other numerical and data analysis techniques.

See my [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1926104) profile for my latest research articles.
